"""Did you ever hear the tragedy of Module Copypastas The Pointless? I thought
not. It's not a story that developers with actual lives would tell you. It's a
meme legend. Module Copypastas was a Python module, so pointless yet
well-documented he could use Sphinx to automatically generate doc pages... He
had such a knowledge of dead memes that he could even keep the ones he cared
about from dying. The dank side of the Internet is a pathway to many abilities
most consider to be a huge waste of time. He became so powerful... the only
thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he
did. Memes only last like 30 seconds before dying, come on. Unfortunately, he
taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice showed him
something from iFunny. Ironic. He could save others from the normies, but not
himself.

a song in Spanish. Already, I began to tremble. I had a bad feeling about this.
“Which one?” I ask shakily, not wanting to hear the answer. “Despacito” She
responds. I begin to hyperventilate. My worst fears have been realized. I fade
in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it’s
futile. The song plays. I’m crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help
me. I curl up on the floor. There’s nothing I can do now. And then it happens.
The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the
damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My
eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I
can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems
like hours, it’s finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My
brain shuts down as my vision fades to black. I muster the last of my energy,
uttering the accursed word.

“Despacito”''')

    print('''To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.
The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics
most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's
nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his
personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for
instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity
to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just
funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike
Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for
instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"
which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons
I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons
scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on
their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way,
I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the
ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ
points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.''')
